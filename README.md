# Heart_Disease_Multivariate_Analysis

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, 
Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted 
attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

This is multivariate type of dataset which means providing or involving a variety of 
separate mathematical or statistical variables, multivariate numerical data analysis. 
It is composed of 14 attributes.
 
One of the major tasks on this dataset is to predict based on the given attributes of a 
patient that whether that particular person has a heart disease or not and other is the 
experimental task to diagnose and find out various insights from this dataset which could 
help in understanding the problem more.


There are various factors associated in the process of determining whether a person will 
have a heart disease or not. In this project, we will do the analysis on some hypothesis and
will come up with some conclusions for the same.

Dataset columns:

age: The person’s age in years

sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: chest pain type
— Value 0: asymptomatic
— Value 1: atypical angina
— Value 2: non-anginal pain
— Value 3: typical angina

trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
- Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
= Value 1: normal
= Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping

ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)

thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously
- Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
- Value 2: normal blood flow
- Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)

target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)
